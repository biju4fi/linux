Sure! Here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. Difference Between a Hard Link and a Soft Link in Linux
- **Hard Link**: A hard link is a direct reference to the physical data on the disk. Multiple hard links to a file share the same inode number, meaning they point to the same data blocks. Deleting one hard link does not affect the others.
- **Soft Link (Symbolic Link)**: A soft link is a pointer to another file name. It has its own inode and points to the target file's path. Deleting the original file breaks the soft link, leaving it dangling[1](https://linuxconfig.org/linux-hard-link-vs-soft-link)[2](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/linking-linux-explained).

### 2. Checking Disk Usage of a Specific Directory in Linux
You can use the `du` (disk usage) command to check the disk usage of a specific directory. For example:
```bash
du -sh /path/to/directory
```
- `-s`: Summarize the total
- `-h`: Human-readable format[3](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-check-disk-usage-by-folder-on-linux)[4](https://www.tecmint.com/check-linux-disk-usage-of-files-and-directories/).

### 3. Common Ways to Troubleshoot a Linux Server That Won’t Boot
- **Check Boot Logs**: Look at `/var/log/boot.log` and other log files in `/var/log`.
- **Use a Live CD/USB**: Boot from a live CD/USB to access the file system and logs.
- **Check GRUB Configuration**: Ensure the GRUB bootloader is correctly configured.
- **Repair File System**: Use `fsck` to check and repair file systems.
- **Reinstall Boot Loader**: Reinstall GRUB if it’s corrupted[5](https://www.turbogeek.co.uk/solved-common-linux-boot-errors-and-how-to-fix-them/)[6](https://www.tecmint.com/find-and-fix-linux-boot-issues/).

### 4. Determine Which Process is Using a Specific Port on a Linux System
You can use the `netstat`, `lsof`, or `ss` commands. For example, with `netstat`:
```bash
sudo netstat -tuln | grep :<port_number>
```
Or with `lsof`:
```bash
sudo lsof -i :<port_number>
```
These commands will show the process ID (PID) and the name of the process using the port[7](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/find-process-using-port)[8](https://gbtimes.com/how-to-check-which-process-is-using-a-port-linux/).

### 5. Purpose of the 'chmod' Command and How to Use It
The `chmod` command is used to change the permissions of files and directories. Permissions can be set using symbolic or numeric modes. For example:
```bash
chmod 755 filename
```
- `7` (rwx): Read, write, and execute for the owner
- `5` (r-x): Read and execute for the group
- `5` (r-x): Read and execute for others[9](https://linuxize.com/post/chmod-command-in-linux/)[10](https://www.howtogeek.com/437958/how-to-use-the-chmod-command-on-linux/).

### 6. Managing User Permissions in a Linux Environment
- **User Management**: Use `useradd`, `usermod`, and `userdel` to manage users.
- **Group Management**: Use `groupadd`, `groupmod`, and `groupdel` to manage groups.
- **File Permissions**: Use `chmod` to set file permissions and `chown` to change file ownership.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Use `setfacl` and `getfacl` for more granular permissions[11](https://sysadminxpert.com/managing-user-accounts-and-permissions-in-linux/)[12](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/manage-permissions).

### 7. Tools or Commands to Monitor System Performance in Linux
- **top**: Displays real-time system summary and process information.
- **htop**: An interactive process viewer with more features than `top`.
- **vmstat**: Reports virtual memory statistics.
- **iostat**: Reports CPU and I/O statistics.
- **netstat**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
- **sar**: Collects, reports, and saves system activity information[13](https://www.tecmint.com/command-line-tools-to-monitor-linux-performance/)[14](https://itsfoss.com/linux-system-monitoring-tools/).

### 8. Function of the 'cron' Daemon in Linux
The `cron` daemon is used to schedule and automate tasks. It reads the crontab (cron table) files and executes commands at specified times. Crontab entries follow the format:
```plaintext
* * * * * command_to_execute
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | +---- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
| | | +------ Month (1 - 12)
| | +-------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| +---------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------ Minute (0 - 59)
```

### 9. Creating a Shell Script and Common Use Cases
To create a shell script:
1. Create a file with a `.sh` extension.
2. Add the shebang line `#!/bin/bash` at the top.
3. Write your commands.
4. Make the script executable with `chmod +x script.sh`.
5. Run the script with `./script.sh`.

Common use cases include automating repetitive tasks, system monitoring, backups, and batch processing[17](https://www.webasha.com/blog/what-is-shell-scripting-in-linux-and-how-to-get-started)[18](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shell-scripting-crash-course-how-to-write-bash-scripts-in-linux/).

### 10. Steps to Secure a Linux Server
- **Update System**: Regularly update your system and software.
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Enforce strong password policies.
- **Disable Root Login**: Disable direct root login via SSH.
- **Use SSH Keys**: Use SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Configure a firewall to restrict access.
- **Install Security Tools**: Use tools like `fail2ban` to protect against brute force attacks.
- **Regular Backups**: Regularly back up your data[19](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-security.html)[20](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-server-hardening-security-tips/).
